## Why

**hexa-pet** is the consumer-friendliest member of the HEXA family. The five
verbs cover the day-to-day surface of cat and dog ownership — food, litter,
toys — at the intersection of consumer-product engineering, animal behavior,
and small-scale material science.

This is the most self-contained pack in the family on purpose: every verb is
a single peer-citable spec doc with physical-limit anchors and a falsifier
preregister, copy-pasted out of the upstream
[`canon/domains/pets/`](https://github.com/dancinlab/canon)
tree (SHA `c0f1f570`, 2026-05-06). No other `hexa-*` repo is needed to use
this one — clone it, read it, hack it.

Why n=6? The HEXA-family lattice gives every verb the same algebraic backbone
(σ(6)=12, τ(6)=4, φ(6)=2, J₂(6)=24), and each verb's spec doc projects that
lattice onto its own physical-limit anchor — bentonite swell ratio, AAFCO
amino-acid registry, nepetalactone vapor pressure, canine bite mechanics,
and so on.

## Status

> **5-verb 반려동물 substrate. Spec-first (working `.hexa` CLI TBD).
> Consumer-friendly self-contained pack.**

What ships at v1.0.0:

- 5 peer-citable spec docs (one `.md` per verb), extracted unchanged from
  `canon@c0f1f570`. These are the source of truth.
- A placeholder CLI dispatcher (`cli/hexa-pet.hexa`) that prints each spec
  doc headline + a 5-verb count selftest.
- `install.hexa` hx hook (mirrors the `hexa-bio` install pattern).
- MIT license — friendly for downstream consumer products + maker remix.

What does NOT ship at v1.0.0 (honest C3 caveats):

1. **No working numerical sandbox yet.** Every verb is spec-only; the CLI
   subcommands print spec headlines, not simulator output. Working `.hexa`
   modules are TBD per the per-verb F-*-MVP-* deadlines (cat-litter and
   cat-food first wave 2026-07-30 ~ 09-30).
2. **Physical-limit anchors are theoretical-analytical.** AAFCO numbers,
   Atwater factors, Wyoming-bentonite swell ratios, nepetalactone vapor
   pressure — all literature-anchored, none lab-measured by this repo yet.
3. **n=6 lattice projections are per-verb hypotheses.** Only the lattice
   itself (σ(6)=12 etc.) is mathematically verified; each verb's projection
   onto that lattice is a working hypothesis pending Bayesian audit per
   F-* gates.
4. **No regulatory pathway.** AAFCO / WSAVA / FAO endorsement is post-MVP;
   nothing here is a medical, veterinary, or nutritional claim.
5. **Consumer-friendly ≠ consumer-tested.** This is a builder substrate, not
   a finished product. No animal trials have been conducted.

## Install

```bash
# 1. Install hexa-lang (gives you `hexa` + `hx` package manager)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dancinlab/hexa-lang/main/install.sh)"

# 2. Install hexa-pet
hx install hexa-pet
```

---

## Run

```bash
hexa-pet cat_food            # feline obligate-carnivore food spec       [SPEC]
hexa-pet cat_litter          # Wyoming bentonite hygiene material spec   [SPEC]
hexa-pet cat_toy             # nepetalactone prey-mimic toy spec         [SPEC]
hexa-pet dog_food            # facultative-carnivore canine food spec    [SPEC]
hexa-pet dog_toy             # Kevlar/rubber canine chew toy spec        [SPEC]
hexa-pet status              # 5-verb status table + verdict + caveats
hexa-pet selftest            # 5-verb spec doc presence count check
hexa-pet --version           # show version
hexa-pet --help              # full usage
```

## Provenance

Extracted 2026-05-06 from
[`canon`](https://github.com/dancinlab/canon)
SHA `c0f1f570` (`domains/pets/` subtree). Source files unchanged; directory
slugs converted to `snake_case` per hexa-lang raw#11 (`cat-food/` →
`cat_food/` etc.). Sister extraction of:

- [`hexa-bio`](https://github.com/dancinlab/hexa-bio) — molecular
  toolkit (4-verb HEXA family, 1/4 wired)
